API Documentation

The API is documented using OpenAPI 3.

OpenAPI file:

server/docs/openapi.yaml

Architecture

This project follows a clear separation of concerns:

ESM-only Backend

Uses ES modules (import / export)

No CommonJS (require)

Layered Structure

Routes
→ HTTP layer only (no domain/business logic)

Services
→ Business logic and validation

Storage
→ JSON-based persistence layer

Middleware
→ Authentication and centralized error handling

Domain
→ Custom error classes (e.g., AppError subclasses)


## Additional Features (Assignment Implementation)

The application was extended with the following features:

### Internationalization (I18n)

The frontend supports **English and Norwegian**.

- Language is detected automatically using `navigator.language`
- Translation files are located in:
  - `public/i18n/en.mjs`
  - `public/i18n/no.mjs`
- UI labels and validation messages change based on the browser language
- Server errors also respect the `Accept-Language` header

---

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

The application can be installed as a PWA.

Implemented using:

- `manifest.webmanifest`
- `service-worker.js`
- application icons

---

### Service Worker Caching

A service worker caches important files such as:

- `index.html`
- `app.css`
- `app.mjs`
- `manifest.webmanifest`
- icons

This improves loading performance and allows the application to function without network access.

---

### Offline Mode

If the network is unavailable:

- cached files are served
- an offline fallback page (`offline.html`) is displayed

---

### Accessibility

Accessibility was tested using **Lighthouse**.

Results:

- Accessibility: **93**
- Best Practices: **100**
- SEO: **90**
